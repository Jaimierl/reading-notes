# Tables, Objects, and the DOM
## HTML Tables
Time to make excel happen in website form. Of course a table is a series of information in rows and columns. There are of course tags that differentiate the information such as the \<table> tag for creating the table, \<tr> for the table rows and \<td> for table cells (where the information goes).

## Let's Get Fancy
JavaScript can be used to take information out of tables. 

The information in a table related to one concept can be called an object. Then the different information can be stored with a property name in the format "object.name = information-stored". Then of course, the functions can work as a part of different variables with inputs that can essentially be calculated or run through the functions. Yes, it is confusing.

An array is another type of table that JavaScript can interact with. Essentially an array has information stored in index numbers (which starts counting at 0) while objects use property names to reference information. Then of course you can pull rabbits out of hats by putting objects into arrays and arrays into objects etc etc.

There are some built-in objects that JavaScript references and understands. The biggest one by sheer mentions so far is the DOM which is essentially a tree that models the sections of webpages. It is useful for being able to reference information that may be stored in different parts of a webpage. There are also certain functions and recognized objects that are built in such as math abilities and time and date capabilities.
