# Reading Notes for Code Fellows

This is my reading notes depot to keep track of notes from assigned study documents.

## About Me

My name is Jae and I currently work as an account manager. 

##### I am very excited to be learning to code! 

### The Growth Mindset 

A growth mindset is essentially a committment to learning. It is believing that you have the capacity to learn instead of just being stuck with the knowledge and innate abilities you alreeady excel at. Having a growth mindset will enable me to embrace challenges, overcome obstacles and welcome being stuck (within reason) as a chance to learn.

How to keep myself in a growth mindset:
- [x] Embrace making mistakes
- [x] Be patient with myself
- [x] Ask for help when needed
