# Reading Notes for Code Fellows

This is my reading notes depot to keep track of my study documents

### About Me

My name is Jae and I currently work as a project manager and a financial coach. 

###### I am very excited to be learning to code. 

### The Growth Mindset 

A growth mindset is essentially a committment to learning. It is believing that you have the capacity to learn instead of just being stuck with the knowledge and innate abilities you alreeady excel at. Having a growth mindset will enable me to embrace challenges, overcome obstacles and welcome being stuck (within reason) as a chance to learn.

How to keep myself in a growth mindset:
- [x] Embrace making mistakes
- [x] Be patient with myself
- [x] Ask for help when needed
