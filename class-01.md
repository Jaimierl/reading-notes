# Reintro to HTML and Javascript

The web works as a giant network getting you from your computers internet service provider to system of servers called the Domain Name System all the way to the IP address of the website you want through the web-server it is hosted on.

## HTTP
### HTTP Structure
HTTP uses elements or blocks to define the **structure** of web-pages. Information can be added into blocks that seperate the parts such as the paragraphs, body, or header. 

It further uses uses tags to enclose the blocks such as \<body>\</body> (similar but different in this case to the Megan Thee Stallion song).

Attributes are the name for details in an opening element that tell more information about the blocks formatting. Attributes have a name=value format such as \<p name=value>

### Markup
**Markup** is the name for the different types of blocks and functions that can be added to a HTML file; The most interesting markup I have seen so far is the \<iframes> tag which can let you splice a window of another site into your page. Ever wonder how google maps was integrated into websites?

### HTML 5
**HTML 5** is the mst recent version of HTML. It makes writing HTML easier since not as many dividing blocks are needed, but it requires adding Javascript to work properly on older web browsers. 

### Site Design
It is important to consider the demographics of the end user and figure out how they will interract with the site. Before the work begins in building the site, it is important to create a site map to establish navigation of the site and a wireframe of the pages which is a simple pencil sketch of what the final project should look like. 

## Javascript
Javascript makes pages more interactive. Have you ever seen one of those pop-ups that asks you to join a mailing list as soon as you enter a page? That's Javascript.

A **script** is a recipe to your computer that completes a task. Scripts are often conceptualized as flowcharts so you can break down the individual steps that need to be done and tell your computer to do them. 

Computers categorize things in their own way. For example, they consider things to be **objects** and they consider characteristics to be **properties**. An **event** is an interraction with an object that can change its properties. A **method** tells a computer how a person can interact with an object in the real-world. All together, computers take in data to simulate things that happen in the real world.
