# Foundations of Javascript

Javascript is essentially a computer language that can make websites interactive by running more complex processes.

## How Computers Work
- Computers work through 4 main processes: **Input**, **Storage**, **Processing**, and **Output**.
- Computers communicate with lots of tiny circuits that talk based on **Binary Code** which allow electrical signal to pass messages of 1's and 0's that the computer can understand.
- These 1's and 0's can be manipulated using computer logic to solve problems, and present information in a way that people can understand and interact with.
- Computers are made of the **Hardware** or physical components and also the **Software** or the written code that tells a computer what to do and how to do it.

## Javascript Basics
Javascript can be used to collect information by requesting **inuputs** which can be linked or changed in some way to create different **outputs**. 

**Variables** are one method of storing information in Javascript. These input variables must be stored with different names and can be used to do math, or change displays to create outputs.
