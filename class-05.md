# Making Websites Look Nice

## Images
One thing that you would think of that makes images look nicer is the images on a webpage.

 ### Image Types:
- Gifs (with a "g" as in gift!) are the moving short clips that would make people in the 1800s think your phone was witchcraft, and then ask what a phone is, and what a photo is too.
- PNG Files are usually the ones with clear backgrounds (or logos if you're a professional) that are great for photo-editing as they usually have clear backgrounds and bright contrasting colours
- JPEG Files are honestly for normal pictures and everything else.

When placing images into a page they have an \<img> tag and - fun fact! - the image tag is one of the few tags without a closing tag. You also need to specify where the image comes from or the source. It is likely better to store the image source with the project because if you reference a picture on the internet, the picture can be removed and your site would end up with a hole in it which nobody wants.

## Color
Not everybody was an art major and if you asked me to pick some colors that go together that would be readily apparent. Luckily for us, there are sites called "color pickers" that can help us put together colors on our sites in a way that makes sense. When you get some colors that look nice there are different ways to call them out such as with RGB (not KGB!), Hex codes, or the most advanced, using the color's name.

# Text
Anyone who has typed anything likely has experience with Microsoft Word and text. Some important text considerations are text type (which can be important to accessibility or make things easier to read) and size as well as spacing, formatting, positioning and reacting to the user.
