## Pair Programming

1. According to CodeFellows, the 6 reasons for pair programming are greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from others, practicing social skills, and  increasing readiness for job interview and the work environment.
2. In my experience, I have found the most beneficial reason to be having someone else able to catch any mistakes in real-time and being able to divide and conquer when researching the next steps to approaching a problem.
3. Pair programming works by having one person type the code or drive, and another person think about and say what needs to happen next, or navigate.
