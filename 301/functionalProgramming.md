# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. Functional programming is creating programming by writing and reusing written functions.
2. A pure function is  a function that returns the same results if given the same variables or arguments and that does not change or otherwise impact the inputs.
3. The main benefit of a pure function is that it is easier to test.
4. Immutability means not changing over time or having a state that is not changed after it is created.
5. Referential transparency means that a function will give the same output for the same input.

## Node JS for Beginners

1. A module is logical ways to break up code into pieces that do certain things. Essentially just another JavaScript file.
2. The word require creates a path from one JavaScript file to another module file.
3. We bring another module into the file we are working on by writing require(./filename).
4. To make a module available we need to use module.exports and set it equal to the functions we want to make available outside of the module. Then in the base file we need to set a variable equal to the answer we will receive from the module.
