# HTML Lists, The CSS Box Model, and JS Control Flow 

## HTML Lists
Okay, we all know what a list is. In HTML we can do reular bulleted lists, numbered lists, and definition lists (the way a dictionary is formatted).

## CSS Boxes
Not the boxes your cat plays in. Content in CSS is surrounded in three different layers. From the inside-out they are the **padding** (essentially between the letters of the content), the **border** (the box around content you would imagine), and the **margin** which is essentially how far from other elements this entire concentric chunk is.

There are many fancy ways to format these elements such as by having pretty designs, shapes, or colors in the border, changing the width of the border, margin, or padding, or choosing where on the page to display the content (such as by adjusting the margins.)

## JS Control Flow
**Arrays** are essentially tables that store information. Whereas we usually start counting with the number 1, arrays start counting with the number 0.

Remember those nifty ultimatum if/else statements? We found the older sibling: the **switch** statement. We define a few different cases here instead of saying else a million times. 

Then there are **loops**. This is for when you want deligate doing something multiple times to your computer. However, the computer needs to be told specifically when to stop running a task. The programmer sets conditions that tell the program not to run anymore, or that make the conditions **false**. 

  - There are **for** loop for *when you know how many times to run the loop*. 
  - There are **while** loops which are *run until the program is false*.
  - There are **do...while** loops which *run until the program is false plus one time*.
