# Git and Github

### What is Git and How does it Work?

Git is essentially a program for being able to work on a bit of a program while the pain program is operational.

The **main** is the basic version of the site or code or program that is being worked on
The **branches** are the places where someone wants to work on something

Benefits include:
- Changes can be made and worked with without impacting the working elements on the main site.
- Multiple coders can work on different branches for fixes, changes, and updates without affecting each other or the main code.
- Previous versions of the main and of branchces in progress are accessible in case you want to bring back old elements or restore a version from before you made a mistake.
- Versions can be kept in the cloud in virtual servers called *repositories* so if something happens to a computer a backup of a previous version can keep you from losing everything you had worked on.

When branches are tested and proven to be working, they can be incorporated in the main.


### Git Vocab
- A commit is saving an updated version of your project
- A snapshot is a reference to the file a commit is stored into. This creates an organized library of changes.
- Local operations is the set of recently saved commits that are stored in your computer without the main system
- Git will track changes or keep track of updates and different versions. It will also note if files are damaged or if information is lost between versions
- Loss of data is prevented by having saved previous versions so information can be recovered
- States are the phase a file is in. A file can be in one of three states which are:
  - Committed or stored in a local satabase
  - Modified or changed without having been committed
  - Staged which is ready and waiting to be commited
