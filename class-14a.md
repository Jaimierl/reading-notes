# CSS Animations

The most important part of animating a web page is remembering that your design does not need to be done in a vacuum. It certainly would be cool if you could remember everything (and maybe you have a photographic memory and can!); Either way it is absolutely a-okay to look up code online.

When looking up code it is very important to learn how to define your searches well to find what you are looking for. This really comes with practice so do not be discouraged if you do not find what you are looking for or even know what to look for.

I usually start out by searching the problem I am having in words, and then looking up the vocabulary used by people asking similar questions. When you think you are getting warmer, you can search for a phrase and the word "examples" and hopefully you will find what you are looking for or at least something similar. In the worst case, you can always ask a friend or an online forum like Stack-exchange - they will probably know what questions to ask to get you closer to what you are looking for.

When you find some code that may be suitable, you should then aim to try to make sure you understand what the code is doing and all of the pieces of the code in question. For CSS, it is important to understand what elements the code is targeting and what the code is requiring those elements to do.

Before bringing new code into your project, you should first take some time to test it. Codepen.io is a website where HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be written side-by-side to test the functionality of code. Here you can change values and learn what all of the elements of the code are doing in a hands-on way. Next, a branch of the code should be made for testing new code. Branches are a form of version-control where the before and after versions of a file are accessible. This is helpful because if the code you are testing does not work with your program you can go to a version before the CSS changes to undo any problems that were created.
