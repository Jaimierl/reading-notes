# Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding items that do not work in your code and hopefully fixing them. It is useful to know how functions work in Javascript to do this. Essentially, Javascript can only focus on one thing at a time. It takes two passes through your code and finds all of the variable names on the first pass, and then runs the variable's code from top to bottom in the order that the variables are called. Essentially this can make for some complicated winding and unwinding of functions if you are trying to follow through your code. Writing things as simply as possible will help you out here.

If you have ever spent any amount of time debugging code, you may be familiar with the feeling of just wanting to put your head through the screen to just make it stop. Instead of doing that, here are some better alterrnatives to deal with that frustration:

### Grab some food! 
 Are you hungry? Get a snack with protein combined with literally anything like a fruit or a carb. Maybe even get a full meal with hald fruits/veg, quarter protein, quarter carb. For me when I am getting super frustrated half the time I'm also super hangry.

### Get code assistance!
There are people out there who have probably ran into this problem before! Make Google your new BFF and go sleuthing. If you don't understand the results make your own post on the sites where the cool kids hang out such as stack overflow or ask someone on your team. Writing code is definitely a team based activity.

### Go do literally anything else!
Step away from the computer. Read something, write something, go outside! It can be really easy to feel so pulled into your project that you are glued to your screen but if you have hit a wall you are probably only building frustration toward your project. I promise it will still be there waiting for you.
