# Thoughts on what Google Learned about Teams

What did Google learn about the composition of successful teams? [(Psst! - Article Here!)](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) 

The main findings are that teams work best when everyone speaks about the same amount, and when team members have at least an average sensitivity for how others on the team may be feeling. Essentially, teams can function well with people who respect each other and not necessarily from people who all have exactly the same backgrounds, especially when all of these similar people are competitive and want to lead the same teams. People with different pasts, personality types, and experience levels can bring different opinions to the table, especially when the team is founded from a place of mutual respect. In other words, successful teams seem to have interpersonal safety where people are unafraid to share, be honest, and take risks.

While there seems to be data supporting pushing workers to work together in teams more, I personally prefer a hybrid approach. I like to have some time with the problems at hand to get familiar with the tasks and goals and to gather my thoughts, before diving in with others to work towards solutions. I can also appreciate how important it is to feel like you are in an environment where different ideas will at least be heard and not immediately dismissed as ridiculous.

While it is one thing to know theoretically that stronger teams are built from feeling safe with expressing thoughts and respecting each others feelings, it is interesting to see how these things play out (or not) in my own life. As a construction project manager, I can see how different teams operate well and poorly and it will be an ongoing item of mine to try to encourage mutual respect in environments that can naturally lack it.
