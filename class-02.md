# HTML and Javascript: A Closer Look Ft. Github

## HTML Text
HTML is used to create the structure of a document. As such there are several tags for text and phrasing that could be helpful when organizing your website. Some of them include tags for: headings, paragraphs, quotes, emphasizing text, and abbreviations.

## CSS Intro
CSS is the programming language that dictates style, more specifically the style within diffrent boxes of the documents. Things can be changed such as the sizes and colours of text and elements as well as the backgrounds, tables, borders, and anything else that remains fixed on the page.CSS commands or **elements** are formatted in the following way:
  - Object to be changed (i.e. heading){
  -   Item to change: What you want to change it to;}
Note the curly brace and the colon between the item to change (called a **property**) and what you want to change it to (called a value).

CSS can be applied to a full page or only to a paticular emement. There are many different ways to targt the CSS to different elements in your page, but using an external CSS Style sheet is usually regarded as the best because you can edit a full site quickly and from one location.

## JavaScript
Javascript is essentially written of formulas that make the computer do things. One common thing to do is to have the computer to remember the value of things. To do this you can use the "let" command or the "Var"(short for variable) command. Then you can store data in the variable by using an "=" sign. It is important to note that variable names are case sensitive. A set of information can be remembered by the computer in an **array**.

Variables can just be remembered or they can be changed with things called operators which can do algebra, link variables, and other activities. Lines of variables with their operations are called **statements** which are step by step instructions for the computer. All togther these statements are called scripts which are recipes for the computer to do things. 

More complex functions can be created by making loops. The basis of loops is made from using comparisons and setting up a contingency with **if's** or **else**. Kinda like an ultimatum from a guardian- if you do your homework you can play video games or else you're grounded. 


## Github Cameo:
When uploading files to github (called **Commits**) it is important to add a **Git Commit Message** saying what problem the new code solves and why this new code was added. It also helps to follow a consistent formatting style so the commits are easy to track and understand for if you are working on code in a team.
