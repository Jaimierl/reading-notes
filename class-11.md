# Audio, Video, Images

## CSS
CSS can be used to create really beautiful web pages. It is always interesting to me to see the things that are possible. Some things that can be done with CSS for Images are:

- Define sizes of images throughout the page
- Choose to put images in the background for sites
- Place images in different locations on the page
- Change the saturation and display features of images
- Create colour gradients on the page (my personal favorite)

## Flash
I just want to take a moment to mourn the passing of Flash. Flash was apparently a movie type that older webpages used to load audio and video on websites. I mainly know it from the awful-to-load computer games that I played while growing up, and the struggle to load flash onto computers I did not have adequate administrator permissions on to keep myself entertained (long live Tor). I would especially like to give a shout-out to addictinggames.com with honorable mentions to Burger Tycoon, and Staggy the Boyscout Slayer 3. As with many things before it, Flash was fading before being handed a death-blow from not being supported by Apple's iphones. RIP Flash, you will be remembered.
