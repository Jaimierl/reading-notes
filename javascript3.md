# Loops in Javascript

As we saw on the [Basics of Javascript Programming](javascript2.md) page, Operators describe the types of functions that can be written in Javascript and the syntax, or rules for writing these functions.

In addition to the basic functions and operations of Javascript, there are **loops** which allow certain functions to be run over and over again. 

Two loops of interest in this class are **for** statements and **while**statements. 

A **While** loop will loop a function as long as one set condition is true. If the condition never becomes false this can loop forever! The syntax for a while statement is:
-       while (condition)
-            statement

A **For** statement will run until a certain condition is not met, or is false. A for statement is quite a bit more complex. The syntax for a for statement is the following:
-        for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
-            statement

- The initial expression is the starting place for the function
- Then the conditional expression is checked much like in a while loop.
- If the conditional expression is true, then the statement excecutes
- After the statement executes, the incremental expression changes the initial expression to make a new starting point.
- Then the function goes back to checking the conditional expression.
