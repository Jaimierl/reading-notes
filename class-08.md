# Thoughts on CSS Layout

After working on CSS code, I am realizing exactly how much work goes into laying out a website and writing every letter of code. It makes me a lot more thankful for the aggregation sites  such as WordPress, Squarespace and even Tumblr that make it not even possible but sometimes easy to build a website.

It really puts into perspective the amount of work that is going on behind-the-scenes with websites that essentially let you drag and drop code. Although these websites can be frustrating to use in their own way, they are cutting down the barrier to entry by letting regular people create fully designed sites without any knowledge of the code that makes it possible. It can convey professionalism or whimsy, information or hilarious content or even promote a business. Making a website is difficult but doable. The biggest lesson is that like an iceberg, a well designed website contains more than meets the eye.

The next time you are having trouble with a pre-coded website template, you can think about what it would take to write every line of text, plus define all of the structural elements in their own blocks, and then make a file that sorts out all of the colors and styles and then write all of the interactive elements and, oh yeah, learn how to do all of those parts too. I can tell you, it is a lot of hard work. Just watch some WordPress tutorials. Or better yet, hire someone like me to do it for you!

The style for a banner type I love is below, and remember these three lines of code are just for setting up the text at the top of the page!

  
header {
    background-color: purple;
    text-align: center;
    padding-top: 5px;
    }

body {
    background-color: #003840;
    color: white;
}

h1 {
    color: #00bcd4;
    border: #00bcd4 5px dashed; 
}
