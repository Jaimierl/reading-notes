# Rest (Not the relaxation kind)

1. Roy Fielding helped create the first web servers and helped explain how servers and browsers communicate with each other.
2. The techniques we use today do not work well when we need to be able to talk with all of the machines in the world because they do not need to be used in that way. The current system only requires a computer to talk with only a small group of machines.
3. Fielding and his friends created the HTTP protocol.
4. The browser runs an HTTP GET function on the url of the page to retrieve a web-page. IT allows systems to retrieve information from one another.
5. The POST function allows one system to add something to another.
6. The PUT function allows a system to replace something in another system.
7. The PATCH function does a partial update in a system.
