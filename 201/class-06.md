# Doms - The Complicated Stuff
## The Problem Domain
The problem domain is essentially a matter of understanding what problem you are trying to solve. While this sounds simple, it is truly crucial to writing code that works because it is based on solving the problem that the client actually has. Make sure you fully understand the problem you are looking to solve and focus on the simplest issue at hand to have the smoothest possible time. Happy Coding!

## Object Literal
Object literal is a way of essentially setting up searchable arrays with different types of information. The information can be recalled by setting a variable, storing information in the variable with colons separating the info types and commas separating the lines of info, and the method which is essentially the function within the variable. The variable is then called with a period separating the variable and information-type: 
- let variable ={
    - confusion: 100
    - codeKnowledge:10
    - frustration:function() {
    - return codeKnowledge-confusion
    - }

## Dom Dom Dom (A Simple View of The Hard Stuff)
The **Document Object Model, or DOM** is essentially a tree-life structure that models an HTML site so that JavaScript can access pages or sections to make the site more interactive.

Elements can be selected from the tree individually or multiple at a time through **Nodelists**. The elements can be selected by anything used to set them apart in the HTML Structure or from CSS identifiers. These elements can then be put through the paces with JavaScript and can even be used to write loops!
