# Local Storage

**Storage** Seems to be the ability for a website to keep user-data on-hand for a short period of time, aka while you are browsing the website. If you have ever been harangued by websites to accept their cookies, that is what the page is trying to get from you. Not to mention the fact that this user data can then be saved and sold to other entities such as corporations looking to target you for ads, but that's another story.

Modern websites use a format called HTML5 which uses local storage. This means that it collects information like cookies to remember you after you navigate away from the site, but the information is stored at your computer and not sent back for storage on the websites server.

This local storage is another interesting thing that you can use Javascript to let the user interact with your browsers HTML code. However, one thing to keep in mind is that this only works on more recent browser types so if you encounter someone running internet explorer on their Windows 2000 Operating system, this method of site interaction will sadly not work with their browser.

Javascript can essentially be programmed to "listen" to the website and store information when certain criteria are met such as someone typing something or clicking a link. Ever wonder how a website can start emailing you and collecting your information even though you did not completely fill out an order form? Mystery solved. An honorable mention for if you already know some Javascript - the information collected is stored as strings, the prompt for the information collected is called the key, and the information collected is called a value. Predictably, the information collection is referred to in key/value pairs.

Believe it or not, local storage is a rockstar in terms of an advancement in interactive ability for websites. Happy Coding!
