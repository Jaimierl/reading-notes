# HTML Links, CSS Layout Basics, and an Intro to Javascript Functions

## HTML Links
Everyone who has used the internet has clicked on a link before. If you have seen the \<a href=blah> tag before then congratulations you have seen behind the scenes.

## CSS Layout Basics
The style sheet or CSS document for a page should be formatted to fit screens of different sizes. This can be done either by creating a lot of different style sheets for all of the contingencies or making styles that are **liquid** or adapable to many different formats. One thing to note is the formatting of the elements. When many elements are linked together in the same block, the block is called a **container**.

## Intro to Javascript Functions
According to "Javascript&Jquery" by Jon Duckett, 
  "Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together to perform a specific task"

Functions consist of the word **"function"** followed by the **" function name"** and most importantly **()**, yes that is an open and closed set of parenthesis and if you forget them you will be in a world of hurt. the parentesis can be empty, or that is where the **input(s)** for the function would go.

Then outside of the function statements, you essentially need to write the function name and *parentesis* (very important) which **calls** the function or asks it to run.

Functions can perform different tasks or multiple tasks in sequence, all depending on the statements that are contained inside. They can also work with a lot of data which is usually contained in arrays.

All in all, Javascript knows how to put the fin in function.
