# Serverless Functions

It looks like we will studying serverless functions in this module. 

According to [ibm](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless), serverless functions allow developers to write the front-ends to their applications and deploy to cloud platforms that handle the backend code. Serverless does not mean that there are not servers, but that the developers do not need to spend time interacting with the servers. 

Something interesting about serverless functions is that they can scale to zero when not in use. This is like turning off the lights in a room you are not using, which also saves the company money on computing when the applications are not in use.

It seems to have the benefit of not using developer efforts to write the backend of the application. One of the cons comes for stable workloads since the companies may pay more. The benefit of serverless is cost savings for spiky use applications. Another issue that has been repeated has been latency issues, so slower operations or timeouts if a lot of code that takes a long time need to be run.
