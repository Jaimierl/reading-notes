# Django CRUD and Forms

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will be looking at implementing forms using Django.

It is really interesting to see that Python and the Django framework has a built in implementation to create and work with forms. Before learning programming, I would have thought that everything on sites was made and built-out with just the CSS and HTML. Seeing forms with Django is solidifying for me that it is a framework or something that we can use to build things out like React. 

To create forms your application needs to be set up for CRUD which means Create, Read, Update, and Delete so that the user can interact with data they want to store in the site (which will be stored as objects with classes to handle their storage and retrieval).
