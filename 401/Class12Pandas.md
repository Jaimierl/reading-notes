# Pandas

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will continue to analyze data. 

Pandas is another tool for data analysis in Python. Panda uses Numpy and also dataframes to manipulate and work with data. Pandas seems like a fast and powerful way to quickly analyze data. What is really interesting is the apparent ease in which subsets of data can be isolated for analysis. Python data can easily be merged, grouped, reshaped or graphed (plotted) for analysis and visual presentation to others. 

I think it will be really interesting to combine opening files and documents, extracting information, and then being able to analyze said information all in one program.
