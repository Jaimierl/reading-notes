# Web Scraping

Web Scraping is an interesting topic because I have heard a lot about it and I am excited to learn more about it. I wonder how it compares or contrasts to reading from files on the OS system. 

BeautifulSoup looks like an interesting library for doing web scraping as it converts websites to unicode so you do not need to worry about a sites formatting.

It is interesting to see that if you pull data from a website too quickly you could even crash the site. We can, for example, read all of the instances of text files in a document. It is essentially like using an api to collect data, except for you ar gathering the data for yourself.

Files will have a /robots.txt page that will show any pages that are disallowed for web scraping. We can use proxies like TOR or VPN and random mouse movements so the site is less likely to notice and ban the scraping bot. 

Some sites also have Honeypots or fake links installed on the sites to lure in hackers.
