# Django REST Framework & Docker

In this module, we will be working with Docker. Docker is a containerization platform that allows teams to essentially share the same development environment without needing to use virtual environments. Virtual environments are great for local projects, but Docker containers take this a step further by being available for teams of people and in the production environment. 

One important concept is the difference between Docker images and containers. An image is essentially a read-only template of what an application would need to run while a container uses the image to run but can then be altered or used to create a modifiable application. A container can take in multiple layers of images. 

Using Django REST and WEB frameworks, we can build APIs. This makes for a managed and fully rounded web application that others can use to pull data from.
