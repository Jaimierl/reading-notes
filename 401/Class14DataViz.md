# Data Visualization

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will be visually representing data. 

MyPlotLib is a library for showing graphical representations of Data. It can handle adding legends, offsetting data, and also having multiple subplots and axes. In later versions it also incudes animations in addition to really interesting plots such as 3d Plots, polar axis, contour, scatter, and quiver plots. It includes different point types and colours for data points and seems to be another useful tool for representing data. 

Seaborn is another intensive program for representing data. It seems to take in more complex data such as functions, data distributions, multi-plot grids and regression models. Similar to MyPlotLib, aesthetics and colour palettes of the modeled data can be manipulated for clarity in the represented data.
