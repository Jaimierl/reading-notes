# Recursion, Testing and Modules

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module because they are integral parts or writing effective code. 

**Recursion** is the process where a function needs to call itself to work. They can solve problems where operations need to be repeated. It is the opposite of learning that a word in the dictionary should not use itself in its definition. For a recursive function to work, it must satisfy a base case. For example, if you want something to equal 100 and you set numbers to subtract from 10 until the base case is met, you will count a stack overflow as you are counting in the opposite direction from where you are trying to count to.

Then there is **Test-Driven Development** which speaks on writing unit tests to make sure that the parts of ones functions work. 

When writing, the testing formula 1,2,3 is a tripple A: **Arranging** the data you need to input, **Acting** or executing the code, and **Asserting** or checking if the output is what you were expecting. When writing tests, they should **fail** (before the code is written), **pass** with your code, and then it can be **refactored**, or made to look nicer. 

To tie into the idea of unit testing, one can test whether their code input any modules (or references any external files) or look for whether a variable is defined within the document.
