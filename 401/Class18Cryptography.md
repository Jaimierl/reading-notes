# Cryptography

It seems like the upcoming module will be related to cryptography. To make a message secret is encryption and to undo the code is decryption. The formula used to decrypt something is known as a cypher.

One simple example of cryptography is the Caesar's shift where the letters of the alphabet are shifted three in one direction. One common drawback to methods of encryption like this is letter frequency. Apparently, E is the most common language used in English and looking at letter frequency can help break cyphers like this. 

A really interesting cypher situation is [Native American Code Talkers](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/american-indian-code-talkers) in World Wars 1 and 2. Unfortunately, the recognition for this work wsa slow and widespread recognition did not come for about 50+ years past the end of the wars.
