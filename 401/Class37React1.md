# React 1

In this module we are going to be integrating a react front-end with a python backend. It would appear that React is a JavaScript framework with unique features such as arrow functions, the React Dom, and all of the other unique features that we have not looked at since 301. React includes all of the components to create a frontend that dynamically updates from user interactions (aka event handling).

When using the React Dom, information gets passed between the different components using props. JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension that are similar to pythons f-strings where variables can be inserted into text strings and displayed to the user. Using JSX, components can display information or class attributes that are passed down as (read only) properties. It is important to remember that the highest level constructor holds the state for the application which needs to be updated to re-render certain sections of the page.

One new thing that we will be adding this time around will be Tailwind for CSS handling. Tailwind differs from Bootstrap in that it is set up with customizable widgets instead of a default user interface theme. [See here to learn more](https://blog.logrocket.com/tailwind-css-vs-bootstrap-ui-kits/). There is also Next.JS which seems to be a library that helps incorporate CSS, helps with building API endpoints with serverless functions and allows for rendering from the server with file specific routing.

A few concepts that would be interesting to learn more about in this module would be Typescript's JavaScript overlay and React Hooks.
