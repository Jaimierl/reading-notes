# React 3

In this module we will be continuing to look at Next.js in React. With Next.js we can use this JavaScript framework to link pages and incorporate CSS choices. There is even a layout component for creating general styling across pages! Next.js also has codesplitting which means it loads only the information the user needs at that time which makes for faster applications.

Then there is React Context that allows for sharing data throughout a React application without the use of props for user data that does not need to be refreshed as often (which can also be done with Redux).
