# Django Models

In this module, we will be studying Django Models. Django models are important because they allow the developer to choose a model, or shape for holding stored data so that they do not need to directly communicate the data to the database. 

One interesting thing about models is that they can be written with UML (Unified Modeling Language) Association diagrams. These are cool because they are so similar to Wiresheet programming. In the case of models, UMLs are a visual way to understand the inputs, cases, classes, and packages and how they interact with each other. This can allow the user to better understand how the parts of their model interact with each other. Wiresheet programming takes this one step further to have calculations run in the different blocks, with inputs and outputs related to controlling a physical system. In this way, a program can be written to take in temperatures, setpoints, or flow to create the program for mechanical equipment such as chillers or pumps.
