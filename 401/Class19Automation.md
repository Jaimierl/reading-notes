# Automation

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as it appears we will be automating tasks using Regex. Regex can be difficult to look at, but it is a system of telling the computer to look for certain keywords or formatting. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-regular-expression-tutorial) has a very clear page explaining writing and understanding Regex in Python.

To read from files, [Shutil](https://pymotw.com/3/shutil/) is a package that extends on the file operations of the Operating system by automating file opening and information copying. [Watchdog](https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/quickstart.html#a-simple-example) is another package that monitors changes in files or the current directory. Together, these packages can monitor a file and send a message or report when something is changed for example.

Automation can be used to move and rename files, track prices on online shopping retailers, or open programs on other sites when updates are made.

I would love more practice with this to see if a file can be read and an email generated with the contents. I have an excel sheet of data that unfortunately has column shift errors that I would like to learn to generate emails with the data for.
