# React 4

In this module we will continue to learn about Next.js 10 with React. Next.js can be used to create dynamic routes on pages. Dynamic routes automatically update to find the best way for information to flow through the components. We can think of this like a recipe site that automatically updates the recommended recipes based on the newest posts to the site.  Next.js applications allow for integration with other libraries and can be deployed with Github and serverlessly with Vercel.
