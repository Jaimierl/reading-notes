# Intro to Django

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will be learning to use Django. Django is a web framework that allows for frontend and backend web development. In the backend it enables users to be able to write classes to integrate to APIs, while on the frontend it allows for connection to URLs, HTML, Forms and Authentication. Additionally, it includes the ability to access SQL Databases, can format time in a built-in way, and has some operational security features. With the ability to integrate text and parse time, it seems like Django would be an excellent framework to create a front-end based on parsing data from other information available online.

Additionally, Django is an open-source project with a Fellows team that reviews and organizes updates and advances to the system. It is used by sites such as Mozilla, Instagram and Pinterest!
