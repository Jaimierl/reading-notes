# Open Source Software Contributions

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will be contributing to open source projects. According to [Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), **open source software** is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

Contributing to open source projects seems helpful in that it helps developers gain real-life practice in working on a dynamic code base, or one that is constantly incorporating new code by other people.  Meaningful contributions to open source projects can also potentially open up job prospects for the developer. Interested developers can add new features that may benefit the project and see the project from new perspectives.

Open source projects also benefit from having more people who could potentially spot and fix any issues or problems that arise in the code. All in all it seems to be a great practice for hands-on learning with existing code bases.
