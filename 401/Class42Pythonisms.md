# Pythonisms

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will further explore Python methods. Dunder methods are built-in python methods that expand classes. 

Iterators are like the background features that can let loops run. They can be emulated by running an __iter__ and __next__ function. It is similar to the process of moving between current and next for a linked list. 

A Generator is like a shortcut program that allows you to write a repeating function in one line. They allow for functions that repeat an operation a certain amount of times. In short, generators produce a sequence of values and can pause in their executions. It will return its numerical answers as an object and pause with the next.
