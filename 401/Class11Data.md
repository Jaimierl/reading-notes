# Data Analysis: Jupiter Labs and NumPy

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will be analyzing data.

Jupiter notebooks seem to be an extension helpful in navigating through large sets of data including images and sheets. The [Jupiter Lab Introduction Video](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) gives a really great introduction to Markdown if you are interested in a review of that. 

NumPy is another data analysis package which (by the name) is more related to numbers. This package is specialized in arrays, and CSV files with data. IT can also be used to reshape or compare data. [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/numpy/index.htm) has a great step-through tutorial for integrating NumPy into projects.
