# React 2 

In this module we will continue work with React. A few new concepts we will cover are:

- Conditional rendering which shows certain components based on the state of the application
- Using list mapping to define item keys
- Handling multiple inputs in forms

A few items from our previous React experiences that we will remember are:

- State that is needed for multiple components should be stored in the nearest common parent
- Components can be children of other components to treat information in different ways or with different levels of specificity.

Then there is HeroIcons a library that allows us to use icons in our React Applications.
