# Ten Thousand Game 4 - Dunder Methods and Statistics

This topic matters in relation to what we are studying in this module as we will be using probability and dunder methods on created classes.

## Dunder Methods 

Dunder Methods are built in Pythonic methods that are surrounded by \_\_doubleUnderscores__. I will continue to wonder if the name Dunder Mifflin from the office has any sort of pythonic pun relationship. According to [Dan Bader](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods) some popular dunder methods are:

- Initialization of new objects \_\_init__
- Object representation \_\_str__, \_\_repr__
- Enable iteration \_\_len__, \_\_getitem__, \_\_reversed__
- Operator overloading (comparison) \_\_eq__, \_\_lt__
- Operator overloading (addition) \_\_add__
- Method invocation \_\_call__
- Context manager support (with statement) \_\_enter__,\_\_exit__

## Statistics

Probability seeks to understand (or predict) the chances of an event happening while statistics is the science of collecting and representing data from testing an event. The most commonly analyzed statistical method is the bell curve which shows the distribution of data around the most likely outcome of an event, and the Z score which shows how likely it is for an event to be away from the mean (which is measured in standard deviations). A **Power Law** is when one variable impacts another in terms of the distribution of data. **Bayesian Statistics** takes additional evidence and conditional probability into account, and is used when the prior data may not have shown the full picture of the experiment.
