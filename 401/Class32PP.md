# Permissions & PostgreSQL

In this module we will be studying permissions and postgreSQL. Permissions are one step in authentication - the user must have the permission to be granted or denied access to certain systems or information. This is the sort of thing that allows a website to allow access if the user is logged in, or allow access to certain bonus accounts if the user has a payment plan with the site. This can be integrated with the creation of APIs or with the DJANGO Framework. This seems like a widely used topic since nearly every site has user login and authentication as a requirement and the majority of sites with login requirements also have paid portions that require advanced permissions which we will be learning how to implement.
