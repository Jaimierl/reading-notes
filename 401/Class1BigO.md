# Pain Vs. Suffering and Big O Notation

## Pain vs. Suffering

The reading for the beginning of this class begins with the difference in pain and suffering. While learning and growing comes with pain, remembering the reason behind the pain and trying to tell yourself that the pain is for a reason is meant to help against suffering. This matters as we embark on a 5 month nights and weekends bootcamp to learn python which, from the reading, will inevitably cause pain. 

This article came with a few questions:

- Whatâ€™s your perspective? My perspective is to try to learn as much as I can from this course while attempting to maintain habits that protect my mental health. 
- Why are you doing this? I would like to have a job where I work with people to solve problems and coding feels like I am on the right track to do so. 
- Do you want what comes at the end of this journey? If what comes at the end of this journey is a software development job (or feeling prepared to embrace the pain of the journey into finding a  software development job), yes. I definitely want to feel like I have the tools to learn more which I am confident will be the case as a result of going through this program.
- Are you doing this for you? Yes.

## Big O Notation

**Big O Notation** describes the worst case scenario of the performance or difficulty of an algorithm. FOrmulas can be described by:
- O(1) where the algorithm will always excecute in the same time and memory space regardless of the size of the input data
- O(N) where the performance will grow linearly with the size of the input
- O(2^N) where the performance will double with every additional input
- O(N^2) where the performance will grow proportionally to the amount of information input(Think of the exponential curve of 2^2)
- O(log N) where the performance will grow by doubling or halving with the size of the input
