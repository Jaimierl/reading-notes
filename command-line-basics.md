# Command Line Basics

### What is a Text editor
Essentially a text editor is where you write code. There are many different text editors out there and people tend to have personal favourites.

Choosing a text editor that you work well with can speed up your code writing and help make sure that your syntax (which is like grammar for code) is flawless so your code works.

A few of the important things to look for in a code editor are:

- Code Completetion \- Essentially predictive type for coding
- Syntax Highlighting \- Makes the different types of code differen colours for easier editing
- Themes \- Which makes things fun and easier to read
- Extentions \- Add ons for when you want to do something new and different.

All of your code is written in text editors so it is important to find one you are compatible with.

#### Command Line
The command line is essentially a text-basesd way to interract with your computer system. Your input to the system is commands and it outputs feedback in text to you.

A few more commands:
- cd is used to change directories. If run without a directory to change to it will take you back to your home directory.
- pwd means print working directory which shows your path aka where in the folders you are currently
- ls which shows what else is in the folder you are in
- ~ is a shortcut to your home directory
- \. is a shortcut to your current directory
- \.\. is  a shortcut to the parent directory
- The tab key may help you auto-type your directory names

Linux sees all navigation/inputs/outputs through files. The thing is it is very picky and has a ton of finnecky little rules such as:
- Caps sensitivity
- Extention names (the part after the dot in example.txt) that are essentially ignored
- Spaces are not allowed in file names unless they are in quotes
- Backslash works to ignore commands like in Markup

The good news is, sometimes files can be hidden which would make life confusing but Linux can easily show hidden files using 
> ls -a 
This will list all files in a directory
