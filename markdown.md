# Markdown for the Non-Technical Minded
## The Facts You Need To Know

Markdown is essentially the easiest programming language. 
It is essentially creating a webpage while using symbols to change the formatting. 
In this example, Markdown is used with GitHub to create webpages. 

Here are some examples of commonly used markdown symbols and how they can be implimented. 
- The \# symbol can be used for headings, with up to 6 \#'s in a row to make 
    - ### Headings 
    - #### Of 
    - ##### Different
    - ###### Sizes
- The \* and \_ symbols can make a word _italicized_ when surrounded by the symbols
- The \** and \__ symbols can make a word __bold__ when the surrounding symbols are doubled up
- Lists can be made by adding numbers with periods
- 1. Like
- 2. This
- The \- can make indented lists like this one

The good news is that once a page is made with Github, the formatting is almost automatic.
This makes your markdown easy to impliment - it is as easy as typing.

#### Happy Coding!
