# Charts and Canvas

## Charts.JS
Charts are a more elegant way to visually represent data and naturally Javascript and HTML can work together to take in information and render charts to your website. By using the Charts.JS tool you will soon be able to render line, pie, and bar charts and even have the ability to make them easier on the eyes by defining colours for the different parts. 

## Canvas - Not the Graphics Site
To use the Chart.JS function, one needs to call the Canvas tag in their html file. This is what tells the Javascript program the information that will be passed into (or displayed) by the chart. 

The interesting thing about using Canvas is that the lines need to be drawn individually on the grid that is laid out by the program. Similarly, if shapes need to be filled in this needs to be manually defined. Not only can straight lines be defined but also circles, images, and even quadratic arcs! Really the time to test how well you were paying attention to maths in school. 

Then to make things even more interesting styles and colours can be applied to the drawn elements. My favourite example is a gradient grid that slowly fades between two defined colours. Honestly, if you have seen a printer's alignment page you have seen this sort of coding in action. Testing various line widths and colours is absolutely a strong point from Canvas design.

Finally, if shapes weren't cool enough for your creativity, text can be defined and the text styling options can be mixed in with all of the fancy styling mentioned above.
