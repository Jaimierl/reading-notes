# Forms and Events

Have you ever sat at the DMV and filled out a form only wish that it could have been done from the comfort of your bed? Well now you can! The next time you are spending the time you will never get back filling out an online form with buttons to click and fields to input information (such as your name and email for a mailing list) just think, for all the time you spent maybe not wanting to fill that form out, think of the time that someone had to spend creating the form and putting every single blank space for you to type and button and color and detail into place. 

An Event is your computer reacting to every single action that happens as a result of user interactions. Think of the major events of your life. From your birth to your kindergarten graduation through the best meal of your life. Then if you are older you may (or may not) remember events like college, your first job or worst heartbreak. Computers similarly "remember" things that happen on the page from the moment you log in as **events**. Believe it or not, there are codes for every possible interaction from mouse clicks to hovering in certain places. Of course, the loads of different interaction types can then be integrated with JavaScript to make the webpage more interactive (and more effectively spam you with ads and requests to join mailing lists).
