# Forms and Events

Have you ever sat at the DMV and filled out a form only wish that it could have been done from the comfort of your bed? Well now you can! The next time you are spending the time you will never get back filling out an online form with buttons to click and fields to input information (such as your name and email for a mailing list) just think, for all the time you spent maybe not wanting to fill that form out, think of the time that someone had to spend creating the form and putting every single detail into place.
